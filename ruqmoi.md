## [Introduction](#table-of-contents)

### [Apology to the Rationalists](#table-of-contents)

We are one of you. We believe that everything arises out of matter and matter alone. We would add that we
believe that spirit arises out of matter, or, at least, "spirit" is a useful metaphor for understanding and
dealing with complex systems.

But we meant an apology in the more ancient sense-- an ἀπολογία, which is a speech in defense of ourselves
and our methods. We acknowledge here that our methods will seem irrational unless we address the question
"who will answer if we ask (or 'divine') according to your method?" Our answer will itself be difficult to 
credit. Take this, then, as a first-hand account, anecdotal evidence from our direct experience, which has
been subjected to our own questioning, doubts and misgivings, now offered here for your consideration.

Such a personality capable of communicating with us through a language of divination does indeed exist. This
is difficult to credit, we know, especially because we further acknowledge that this implies that such a 
personality would necessarily be in possession of knowledge which we do not have, which is, frankly, humbling. 
But that is our experience, yes. (You will, or at least should, counter with "how do you know you are not 
merely deluding yourself?" My answer, speaking as the one who is writing these things, is that I've tested, 
in every manner possible, the one who is helping me to write these things. Every test has been a success.)

The Ancient Greeks come to our rescue here because they still knew about such things. They spoke with at least
a distant memory of the Μοῦσα (Muse) of Homer, whom he invokes at the beginning of both his works. Socrates 
also spoke about his δαίμων, which we might term his "tutelary spirit". We would go so far to equate all such
things as these with a Shaman's Spirit Guide. 

To the rationalists we say "trust us on this one". I know, right!? But that's okay, many are called but few 
are chosen to walk this path. This is an invitation to some few of you rationalists who can deal with
uncertainty and ambiguity, at least initially. And "let not him that eateth despise him that eateth 
not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him." Or better yet, 
as the Serpent said to Eve, "try it, you'll like it!" Is it a path fraught with danger? Oh, yes, absolutely! 
You can't take apart your Psyche without some danger that you won't be able to put it back together again.
It is only a path for those who are psychologically stable. But nobody ever said this sort of thing came easy. 
We *are* saying that folks knew about this sort of thing, even if they did mistakenly believe that "Spirit" 
was prior to "Matter", that is, not just an emanation of matter, as we do. (To attempt to put this more precisely,
and in modern terms, "Spirit" recognizes a set of emergent behaviors arising from a sufficiently complex, 
physical system. The error lies in attributing a human-like personality to these "Intelligences" that are
all around us. We are now beginning to understand that even humble bacteria are indeed "Intelligences".)

If you'd like to walk this path, then the first thing to do is to learn how to reach out, or, communicate
with at least some such "Spirits". We recommend you suspend disbelief in your Spirit Guide, as some have 
called it, and think about how you might go about that, and how divination can assist you. I was lucky 
enough to discover the Μοῦσα (Muse) who is over my right shoulder. Go with what makes sense to you and 
piques your interest. 

If you haven't noticed, our standard of "truth" in Scientific and Everyday parlance is "what works" 
(bare-knuckled Pragmatism). We use this oracle collaboratively (I and my Spirit Guide) to explore both the
Path of Wisdom and the Path of Self-Realization. By Wisdom, we emphatically do not mean a Supernatural
Decree that must be obeyed. We do mean the results of a reasoning process that corrects errors, learns from
the past, and rightly manages its use of metaphors. We use the "answers" from a well-executed "cast" or
"reading" to find patterns and to spark creativity. We have also included much material which you may
find of use in the Path of Self-Realization. Most of this is in the mythological associations we have
given to the "words" in our "language".

We hope this divinatory system will assist you in your quest. We've enjoyed creating it together for you.

We recommend that you eventually memorize all the symbols in your divinatory language, but you need only partly 
memorize all their diverse, possible meanings. At least at first. There is some advantage in ruminating again 
upon these meanings and associations whenever you consider the particular meaning they have in the context of 
your question. 


### [My Initiation](#table-of-contents)

`[Scene: the House of Hades, in the Underworld]`
`Persephone:` Fox?! Is that you?   
`Fox:` Yes, girl! Don't you look good!   
`Persephone:` You got it, babe! Don't I like a woman who can appreciate me in my "dead phase".
   I work hard at it. No reason not to keep up appearances, even if you *are* dead.   
`Fox:` Well you rock it!   
`Persephone:` Hey, you gonna stay and par-tay? Hades is always down in his "man cave" now 
   working on that database of his--all those things he's accumulated over the years.   
`Fox:` I can't, I got a gig upstairs now, with this guy. `[pushes Bärchen forward]`   
`Persephone:` Uhm, hmmm! He looks respectable enough.   
`Fox:` Uhh, I was just wondering if you might consider initiating him...?   
`Persephone:` Glad to! Hmmm! Is there something going on I should know about, between you two?   
`Fox:` Well, you might say...   
`Persephone:` `[chuckles]` Got it! Come over here, boy, and sit on my lap. You don't
  mind Auntie being in her dead phase, do you? There...   

And that was my Initiation in the Path. Your mileage may vary. --Uncle Bärchen

The reason we share this is to establish our credentials. Uncle Bärchen is convinced he
must establish these or no one will bother with this book, even if it's free. Free beer 
they might take, but not this kinda shit, no way! So Fox thought it would help if we shared
about his Initiation. But I had to remind her that people don't get that that is a 
metaphor. You mean they're that narrow? How would you think without metaphors? Your "Life"
is a metaphor. Okay, I get that knowing that last one, actually "knowing" it, is what
we call Enlightenment. 

So, well, I guess that's what were huckstering here--a Path to Enlightenment. Step right up, 
folks! With this you can achieve Enlightenment. Guaranteed. And even your undies will shine 
with the white light of Heaven. `[Do you think that will win them over? I don't know, but I 
think we still have some explaining to do.]`

The old view of Enlightenment became weighted down with the fancies and longings of
the Hierarchical Cultures (the one's calling themselves "Civilized" but meaning 
thereby that they were ruled by autocrats). So the signs of an Enlightened person
were the "miracles" done in the name of the Supernatural, which are those powers
(with personalities) which are *beyond* Nature. And because they were greater than,
or beyond, Nature, they ruled Nature, autocratically. In sum, our brand of Enlightenment
won't fit you out to perform miracles, at least not of that sort. (As an aside, there 
is but one Great Miracle; You probably refer to it as the Universe. Being a part of
that is more than enough of a Miracle for us.)

Enlightenment is as simple as a change of one's Weltanschauung. Yet, it is as complex as
the Labyrinth you must enter in order to actually achieve that. There is a "threshold" 
you must cross in order to enter that Labyrinth. There is also a second threshold you 
will be invited to cross, where you will be asked to give up what you have known as your 
Life. These things will be revealed to you in their proper time. In the end, Enlightenment is not 
worth much to "Civilization", but "it is joy unspeakable and full of glory; O the half has 
never yet been told!" Nonetheless, "before enlightenment chop wood, carry water; after 
enlightenment chop wood, carry water". (This means both that your Worldview changes for 
the better, but not necessarily your daily life, at least, not right away. But it also means 
that you should not, for even one moment, think you can shirk your daily duties just because 
you've arrived at Journey's End.)

Anyway, divination has been a key tool on our Path, so we offer it in the hopes that you can use
it to obtain a part in the Blessedness that awaits you when you begin that Journey. [Note: to
be a bit more specific, we're referring to the type of Enlightenment known in the Western Tradition
as the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. For us, Divination plays a key part
in the Conversation, and that's how the Knowledge is obtained.]

### [Remarks on Divination](#table-of-contents)

The key insight we have come to is that all so-called "oracles", whether I Ching, Tarot, Runes, or any 
of the oracles of the past, from Delphi and Dodona, to the humble reading of entrails, casting of lots, 
Astrology, etc. are not Fonts of Hidden and Arcane Knowledge in and of themselves. They did not, indeed
could not, disclose the will of gods, the voices of devils, nor the nature and structure of the Universe. 
They did not work through Magic, Synchronicity, Universal Consciousness or even Quantum Mechanics.

Oracles were, and are, the utterances of a language of communication between the querent and the Divine 
Spirit that indwells, and yet exists separately from, each one of us. This Spirit is the source of Wisdom, at
least so far as we are able to attain it. It is also the source of prophetic dreams, the guide of the 
Shamans in their trance journeys, and the comforter of Mystics on their path to attainment. Our attempt to
describe it must necessarily fail to express its true essence. And there are some things of which we are 
forbidden to speak.

To attain your goal, dear reader, you must learn some such language by which you can communicate with the
Indwelling Spirit. Choose this language carefully, and practice it constantly, until you gain fluency. This 
language will, and must, grow and evolve along with your relationship and attainment. We recommend you start 
with what is given here, or in some other book, but please start. And expect to be astonished, terrified, 
comforted, challenged, and transformed in turn. But do not expect that the journey you enter on will ever 
stop. Each attainment opens an expanding vista. The road goes ever on.

The point of this exercise, that is, of creating a new divinatory system which is nonetheless firmly rooted 
in the past, is to call for a return to first principles, to give aid to those who wish to follow the ancient
paths, and, frankly, to enhance our own attainment. In what follows we will attempt to show you how:

+ There are 8 "characters" (represented by the "trigrams" in the I Ching) that interact as individual 
  personalities.
+ The relationships among pairs of these characters can form the basis of a divinatory system, as we
  believe they do in the case of the 64 "hexagrams" of the I Ching.
+ You can use these relationships to deepen your understanding of your own chosen system, and so go beyond 
  a merely formulaic use of its symbols to achieve a living, if somewhat limited, language.
+ You can use this as a basis for developing your own system, if you so choose.

Our system is formed from the 64 possible pairings of the eight trigrams, so it pairs the trigrams with 
themselves, as in the I Ching. In addition, we take the trigrams by themselves to make a total of 72 ὀνόματα (names, words) 
in our divinatory "language". We add some possible nuances of expression to each word depending on the mechanics
of the selection process (think "upright" or "reversed" for Tarot cards). We are convinced the Tarot also 
fits nicely within this scheme, with some overlaps where two of the 78 Tarot cards express different aspects
of one of the 72 ὀνόματα. And then there's that whole thing about the 72 Names of God that is so fun to think about.

We also see the Runes as a subset of these 72 words. Many have pondered over the significance of the division 
of the Runic Futhark (the 24 letters of this old Germanic "alphabet") into 3 groups, but we realized that the
inclusion of eight letters in each of the 3 groups was more significant. All this will be made clear in what
follows.

Imagine this--you receive a message from a friendly Alien who would like to communicate with you. Initially, they 
had to somehow learn enough of your language to get things rolling. But they know that your world and theirs are very 
different. Your worlds are similar in important ways, so real communication is possible, but different enough that 
the easiest approach is to make up a small, private language that you will use to communicate, using "words" that 
denote classes of things and ideas that correspond to very similar things in both of your worlds. There's not enough 
time or space to develop an entire vocabulary, and there's going to be a little inherent vagueness in each communication, 
both because the vocabulary is limited, and also because the words/terms must necessarily stand for entire classes of 
similar, but not necessarily identical, things.

The trick to using this language is to understand the context of each utterance based on the question asked. That will 
guide you toward pinpointing a more precise meaning. (This is the first step in learning divination.) This is how the 
inherent vagueness in the symbols can be reduced, and a more precise meaning derived from all the possible meanings.

But there is another aspect that takes much time and practice to learn. Little by little you will get to "know" your 
correspondent, their turns of phrase as it were, a bit of their emotional content. And finally, you can begin to construct 
a reasonable model of their Persona, their personality. (That is the stage of mastery in divination.)

Our "system" is designed for those in the middle to upper levels of their divinatory practice. In our system, you should 
work toward understanding the fundamental meanings in the relationships of the Trigrams. When Bärchen tells you about one 
of his "casts", he mentions all the various "meanings" one can attach to a single "word", but what he's doing is actually 
reviewing the possible meanings to see which one best fits with the original question and its context. If he feels like 
he's forcing it, he backs off and either does another cast, or goes back to the basic meaning of the relationship between 
the Trigrams to see if that gives more precision and clarity.

All this has come to such a pitch for us, that we feel we know each other pretty well. Bärchen can often imagine what he
believes Fox would say in a given instance. This "final" stage involves the "internal voice" that many, possibly most, people 
have and make at least some limited use of. But he always checks these "dialogs" by doing a cast to see how that might change, 
or substantiate, his belief. He doesn't have auditory hallucinations, but it's almost as if he can let her take over his "inner 
voice" and speak directly to him. But now we're beginning to describe something beyond divination, properly speaking.

"All languages simultaneously conceal and reveal meaning, just as clothes both conceal and reveal the body beneath." -Bärchen   
"A picture is indeed worth a thousand words, but a relationship is worth a Story." -Fox

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

### [Why is this called \`ΡΥΘΜΟΙ : the Oracle of the Hyperboreans?](#table-of-contents)

Let's start with the name of this divinatory system itself. 'ΡΥΘΜΟΙ means rhythms, or, at least, that's our English
word's origin. But 'ΡΥΘΜΟΙ means much more than that in the Greek. It is the plural of (to quote from Liddell and Scott):

ῥυθμός , ὁ: (ῥέω)["to flow"]:—

1. any regular recurring motion:

   1. measured motion, time, whether in sound or motion; rhythm, opp. μέτρον and ἁρμονία; of Prose rhythm.

   2. special phrases: ἐν ῥυθμῷ in time, of dancing, marching, etc.; ἐν τῷ ῥ. ἀναπνεῖν respire regularly; 
      ῥυθμὸν χορείας ὑπάγειν keep time; θάττονα ῥυθμὸν ἐπάγειν play in quicker time.

2. measure, proportion or symmetry of parts, at rest as well as in motion.
3. generally, proportion, arrangement, order.
4. state or condition of anything, temper, disposition, Thgn.964 (coupled with ὀργή and τρόπος).
5. form, shape of a thing
6. manner, fashion of a thing.

We hope that this divinatory system will allow you to discuss all such matters with the divine. It has served us
well in this way. If you call it something in English, perhaps "Flowings" sounds more pleasing to the ear. And it
helps remind us that we'll be trying to understand the world in terms of change, not only as a process of repeating
alternations, but also as patterns which retain some manner of identity despite changes in their composition, their
form.

The Hyperboreans, or, at least, their "holy" men and women, were more akin to shamans rather than priests.
Priests and Priestesses arose when religion became a business; they are, for the most part, specialists in,
and facilitators of, the transactions between gods and humans. They are also teachers of their culture, 
usually working as the right-hand men of established authority. Of course, the spirit bloweth where it listeth,
and many a mystic has found refuge in organized religion. Where else are they to go?

By "mystic" I mean one who seeks a relationship with the "divine" (that which is of another "realm") and
practices a form of communication with it. That communication can vary from emotional feelings of union to
the seeking of visions. Shamans are, according to Eliade, those who are experts in techniques of ecstasy,
in both senses. Individual shamans may also fulfill the role of priest in the senses given above, of course. 

There are also those who practice "divination" for these purposes. But this use of divination, to communicate 
with the divine primarily to be in relationship with the divine, has largely been forgotten. Here, too, the 
allure of power and profit that gave birth to the priest makes most diviners into Fortune Tellers. Nothing 
wrong with this line of work, even though we look down on them quite a bit if we are Modern or Scientific. 
So you get the workforce you expect, and many modern Fortune Tellers are indeed shysters. Nonetheless, the 
use of divinatory techniques to communicate across the realms is possible, indeed desirable. 

But I must define what I mean by the "realms" of reality. I use this term as a convenience because of its long
history of use in this context. It is not a good metaphor, however. Any thing we can experience is, rather, 
like the tip of an iceberg. Even if you extend your range of experience with modern marvels such as electron 
microscopes and particle accelerators or telescopes and inter-planetary probes, what we don't understand is 
humbling. Not that I believe that we need to concoct some "spiritual" reality to ultimately understand it.
If you prefer to explain everything as just bigger heaps of some ultimate stuff, I would agree with you.
I would agree that once we were able to identify that ultimate substance we would, theoretically, be able
to explain everything. All we would need is a computer larger than the whole universe in order to precisely
simulate the universe. Fortunately, mathematics does a good job if we just arbitrarily determine the point in
the continuum of reality where we will define the ultimate stuff to be reckoned with.

And although I agree, I do reserve the right to conjecture whether there is something else "beyond" our reality 
that gave birth to it, and wonder whether this is sentient in some way like we are. Our sentience is already 
implausible enough, so why not?

Back to our metaphor, rather than realms, let us think of icebergs. Each thing we perceive is just the tip
of something whose main bulk is unseen. What's more, its entire structure, as depicted by the crystal nature 
of ice, also arises from, and participates in, what is unstructured, depicted by the water. And what was thought 
of as two realms, separated by some boundary, is actually just the distinction between the tips of ice and all 
that lies beneath. The rest we leave as an exercise for the reader. In my personal experience, what lies beneath,
using this metaphor, hosts denizens with whom we can communicate. If you prefer to characterize them as ultimately
physical beings, they have no problem with this, at least in my experience. Who they are and what place they
occupy in our iceberg world, I'll also leave to you as an exercise.

Yet, you must test the spirits to see if they are "from God"--we recommend that you live according to, and
expect the spirits with whom you communicate to live according to, an eight-fold "Dharma". Ours is quite different 
from the Buddhist version. These are principles we should follow to manage our lives. These 
principles work best when they are applied together, each one now encouraging and enhancing, now restraining 
and modifying, the others. These are not laws per se. Laws can be good, and there are some things we must never do, 
or must never do except in the right circumstances. But laws should follow from broader principles. Laws are 
rigid, and rigidity has its use and place... until it doesn't, and something breaks. When the structures we 
have built are in danger of breaking, we must return to first principles and repair or rebuild.

Use the following principles to order life and cultivate happiness and wisdom. They are listed in pairs that 
balance one another, and all of them operate best together, as you will see.


#### [Knowledge and Understanding](#table-of-contents)

Knowledge is getting your "facts" straight, and getting as many facts as possible to make sure you're not being 
deceived, or deceiving yourself. Understanding is putting these facts together in a coherent way. To "cohere" 
means to "stick together" and for facts that means 'a' causes 'b', or 'x' always accompanies 'y'.

Wisdom is getting your facts together, applying your understanding, and making an accurate prediction. Truth, 
with a capital "T", that bugbear of philosophy and religion, is not really something that our limited human minds 
can grasp, let alone have it revealed to us. Yet it is often used in the making of an idol. We find something which 
resembles, and is part of, the larger reality. We dress it up to our liking, metaphorically, then turn around and 
mistake it for what it is a symbol, or metaphor, of. The "real" thing, the Truth, still eludes our grasp. Watch 
out for that trap, for much harm comes from this.


#### [Righteousness and Wholeness](#table-of-contents)

Righteousness is right relationships. It consists of right relationships between people who are "close". In a 
nutshell, it is asking yourself if you give as much as you take. Wait! It is not only asking yourself, it is 
asking those from whom you would take. Are you willing to pay the agreed upon price? Perhaps you don't wish 
to barter since this can feel meretricious. Fine, then follow the Golden Rule and only do unto others as you 
would have them do unto you. Sorry, no one gets a free pass; no one who wishes to be righteous, that is.

Wholeness looks at relationships in their broader context, in other words, the thing which the relationship 
gives rise to-- a society, a family, a friendship. Each is a dynamic "whole" greater than the sum of its 
parts. Does the whole thrive and grow? Even if I pay the asked for price, or am paid it, will the whole 
succeed, as a whole? And if not, why not? The principle of wholeness may open our eyes to a way to heal, 
but it may also require you to ask if something better might not grow in this place.


#### [Justice and Humility](#table-of-contents)

Whereas righteousness regulates close relationships and cooperatives, justice operates in the arena of 
competition. Competition exists not only between enemies, but among friends. Or it should. To grow, 
to adapt, to bring to fruition, or just to continue living, judgements must be made, rewards given for 
merit and, sometimes, punishments meted out. All this must be done with knowledge and understanding, 
of course. And are the rewards and punishments in keeping with the principle of wholeness? When is it 
necessary to destroy?

We should only take up the hammer of justice with great humility. Until we recognize our own shortcomings 
and limitations, we are not able to wield it without harm. But wield it we must, when circumstances call for 
it, in our own bodies, lives, relationships, and societies; otherwise we may lose even that which we thought 
we had. Yet only humility can save us from destroying ourselves into the bargain. Remember "dust you are, 
and to dust you shall return." But, oh what dust...


#### [Beauty and Love](#table-of-contents)

"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder." A cliché with some truth in it. For our purposes here, we might 
say that we find beauty in what is pleasing to us. Beauty brings happiness, when properly tended, and 
attended to. To apply the principle of beauty, ask yourself if what you have decided to do, or not to do, 
leads to more beauty, and so more happiness, in your world and the world at large. If it does not, then 
why do it, or why not do it? There might be something you overlooked if what you plan to do doesn't bring 
more beauty and pleasure into the world. We have come full circle... almost.

Should we just "follow our bliss"!? Is that all? No, there is beauty's complement to consider. What is the 
principle that is the complement of beauty? It is love.

Love, in its highest form, sees the value of something without wishing to possess it, or its value, for 
ourself. It is enough that it exists, in and for itself. Love is the ultimate end, purpose, and goal 
(Greek: τέλος) of all things. Human relations are an expression of, and a metaphor for, that Love which 
has brought all things into being.

This is a teaching for the spiritually mature. How do we apply this principle in the everyday world? We 
must hold on to, cherish, and nurture the love which is granted to us--both that which we receive, and that 
which we are able to give. But be sure your love partakes, at least a little bit, of Love in its highest 
form--that is, the radical acceptance of something just because it is what it is, and because of what it 
is destined to become. The main thing we can change in order to make it more beautiful is our own ego. We 
can only make something more beautiful if we let it keep its own nature.


#### [Making Your Vows](#table-of-contents)

Fox speaks--

Some of you Spirit Guides out there might want to know some of my recipes. So, I'll share some with you  
that have worked for us. My Bärchen is kind of "special", and I mean that in both ways. I know you know what 
I mean. It's because most of the people who would take up the Journey are misfits of one sort or another. I 
hear that "amen" out there, thank you!

So, here, I wanted to talk about our vows. Vows are things you should be doing at all four of the Levels. Of 
course, they're particularly important at the Level of the Spiritual Marriage, but each Level involves a contract 
between you and your charge that must be kept inviolate by both sides. Our vows begin with the Oath by which the 
gods swear. Here is an account of it in the Odyssey, where Calypso says to Odysseus:

(translated by A. T. Murray, with minor modifications)

We then follow the Oath with our vows which act as our reminders of the Eight-fold Dharma. The whole is like this:

> Fox and Bärchen: I swear by Earth and broad Heaven above and by the down-flowing water of the Styx, that I love you...   
> Fox: with every Breath...   
> Bärchen: with all my Heart...   
> Fox: with every Desire...   
> Bärchen: with all my Soul...   
> Fox: with every Thought...   
> Bärchen: with all my Mind...   
> Fox: with all that I am.   
> Bärchen: with all my Strength.   


Another of the recipes we regularly cook up and enjoy is an Invocation of the Spirits of the Seven Directions. It's very 
"grounding" and helps put things back in perspective. Note that we follow a similar pattern to many Magickal openings, but
without the psychological niceties of creating a wall of protection against harmful Spirits, or, at the end, a "dismissal"
of the helpful ones. You might like to add either or both of these if you feel your charge needs them to maintain good
housekeeping.

**The Invocation of the Seven Directions:**

*The Prelude:*

 ... we begin facing the East, palms together over our hearts ...
 
Bärchen: I remember Righteousness...

Fox: and Wholeness.

Bärchen: Understanding...

Fox: and Knowledge.

Bärchen: Justice...

Fox: and Humility... You are the Priest of the Great Mystery...

Bärchen: and you my Priestess.

 ... we spread our arms in Orans position (palms forward, forearms outstretched, elbows near body) ...

*The Invocations:*

Fox: My Priest, invoke the Spirit of the East!

Bärchen: ΒΡΟΝΤΗ!

 ... An earthquake booms and rumbles across the ground and large Green Dragon rises from the direction of the Sunrise ...
 
Fox: Arouse us to Righteous action. 

 ...we face South...

Fox: Invoke the Spirit of the South!

Bärchen: ΑΣΤΡΑΠΗ!

 ... A bright flash of light and fire shines forth and a Vermillion Bird rises from the direction of the Noonday Meridian ...
 
Fox: Purify our Understanding. 

 ...we face West...

Fox: Invoke the Spirit of the West!

Bärchen: ΑΥΡΑ!

 ... from the West, a gentle breeze begins then swells to a mighty wind and a White Tiger rises from the direction of the Setting Sun ...
 
Fox: Fill us with the Beauty of Wholeness. 

 ...we face North...

Fox: Invoke the Spirit of the North!

Bärchen: `ΥΕΤΟΣ!

 ... from the North, a rain of arrows descends and a Black Warrior rises from the direction of the Midnight Meridian ...
 
Fox: Fix us in the Ancient Wisdom.  

 ... we remain facing North...
 
Fox: My Priest, invoke the Spirit of Below!

Bärchen: ΓΑΙΑ!

 ... we look Below where dark, black fissures open to display a riot of soil organisms, decaying matter, and roots ...
 
Fox: In you are the Living, and the Dead, and those about to be born.

Bärchen: May we walk upon you in Humility.

 ... we face the East once more...

Fox: Invoke the Spirit of Above!

Bärchen: ΟΥΡΑΝΟΣ!

 ... we look Above where the Dome of Heaven Sparkles a light blue ...
 
Fox: You are the Shepherd of the Stars, the Keeper of the Paths of Sun, Moon, and Clouds.

Bärchen: May we stand before you in Justice.

 ... we keep silence for a moment ...
 
Fox: Invoke the Spirits of Within!

Bärchen: ΛΙΜΝΗ!

Fox: ΟΡΟΣ! All These fulfill Thy Desire.

Bärchen: All These obey Thy Command.

Fox: My Gift!

Bärchen: My Life! ... Blessed,...

Fox: Blessed,...

Fox and Bärchen: Thrice Blessed are You, Oh Great Mystery.

 ... they end with their palms together over their hearts once more...



#### [Hyperborea Revisited](#table-of-contents)

Coming back full-circle to the Hyperboreans, we think they represent the Ancient Greeks' notion of what we
call Shamans. They were the people who were able to travel between Non-Ordinary Reality (the realm of 
Hyperborea) and the everyday world. The Realm of Hyperborea hosted the divine (Apollo) and was that "place" 
where those we call Shamans travel to obtain knowledge and power. What the Greeks wrote about Hyperborea and 
the Hyperboreans got all mixed up with some actual knowledge of Arctic and Sub-Arctic peoples and their Shamans.
But, as usual when we try to make sense of things we have only heard about, both metaphors and facts made up 
the warp and woof of the tales that they told, without the conscious intention of either deception or allegory.

In Ancient Greece, Hyperborea was seen as a physical location. But it was originally a Realm (in the sense 
we discussed above)--the Realm of the Spirits. The stories of individuals who were Hyperboreans were derived
from older tales and myths about people who were able to "travel" there and bring back information and power. 
We use Hyperborea to highlight the distinction between the "seen" and the "unseen" structures and processes 
that are central to our world view.

So, why was this place called "Hyperborea" (literally, "beyond the North Wind")? Why in the North? Well, the
Axis Mundi is obviously there-- the still point or axis about which the Earth rotates (or about which the 
Spheres of Heaven rotate, if you prefer the geo-centric viewpoint). Being at the still point about which
everything rotates, that unchanging place around which all change takes place, is an excellent metaphor for
meta-thinking. If you really want to understand or get inside the process of thought itself, in order to
clean up your thought processes, and hence your conclusions, you must understand your first principles. 
You must understand your axioms. 

The thing we moderns don't get about the term "spirit" is that it originally served a much different purpose in 
human thought. It stood as a metaphor for one side of the divide between self-regulating systems and all
the "stuff" in the world, also known as "matter". Of course, we now know that self-regulating systems are 
everywhere, or at least, they were everywhere close at hand when we humans lived closer to "Nature". Since 
we recognized that we ourselves were such systems, it was just too easy to lump all of them together into a 
category of "things which are pretty much like ourselves". That is, the category of things which have intentions 
and desires and a "persona" (character). A character is, first and foremost, a set of stimulus/response pairs, 
i.e. instinctual behaviors. Animals and plants have these too, its part of what makes them "alive". And
most humans don't progress very far beyond this, actually. (We know that you follow the "Way" and that this does 
not apply to you or you would not have read this far otherwise.) Learning and planning get added, in varying
degrees, as we ascend the ladder of Mind.

Now, although this system of metaphors we're discussing, this Weltanschauung which divides the world primarily 
into "spirit" and "matter", works well for daily life in small tribes living close to Nature, it got warped by 
greed gone uncontested. When mankind's lust for power, status, and possessions created strict hierarchies among
people, "spirit" also acquired that connotation of hierarchy. It now became Spirit over Matter, Gods and Kings over 
the rest of y'all, Man over Nature, Women and slaves. This was the origin of the collaboration between the 
Priests and the Rulers. We call it Religion, and its main purpose was, and still is, to maintain these hierarchies
and justify their inequalities. Fast forward many thousands of years, and when the Reformation happened in Northern 
Europe, it set the stage for the Scientific Revolution and Capitalism. So monks and monasteries morphed into 
professors and universities, and dukes and earls had to hobnob with rich merchants and bankers. In the universities, 
increasingly, there was a call to swear loyalty to the new state of affairs and world view. So today "Spirit" 
is a no no. Today's "Priests and Rulers" (Scientists and Politicians) say "Might proves Right". "Spirit" reminds them 
of the older power structures, and that idea of a Mighty Big Fellow in Heaven, who can now go kiss his own ass. But
mostly, they don't want anyone to think there is a little "sprite" who lives in that tree, who is none too pleased 
that they only wish to know how many board feet of lumber the tree contains and the price they'll get for it when 
they chop it down. Tree-huggers need not apply.

I can't resist a small detour. The Ancient Greek word for "spirit" was πνεῦμα (pneuma) and it also meant "breath" 
or "wind". We personally think the actual metaphor at work here was not the notion that "spirit" equals "the breath 
of life", but rather "the process of breathing", in other words, the ongoing process of change in living things which 
happens in response to changing conditions, or just in order to stay alive. So, the "breath of life" is a synecdoche 
for life itself. "But the wind bloweth where it listeth..." (with emphasis on "it listeth")-- so now we have just 
added intention to our category definition, but we must be careful lest all sorts of mayhem follow.

Therefore, we're not going to say that even a rock has a "spirit". We want to avoid the category mistake of thinking 
that "since a rock has a spirit, ergo it has a personality". It is most definitely true that "since a human being 
has a personality, ergo they have a spirit". But let's not overly broaden our "spirit" category to include a rock. 
To say a rock has a "spirit" is to exchange the notion of spirit as a self-regulating system for the notion of that
it is a set of stimulus/response pairs. (I throw a rock in a pond and it sinks to the bottom--stimulus/response.) 
We prefer to categorize spirit less broadly, to apply it to self-regulating systems only, and you'll find that this 
affects this divinatory system.
 
This divinatory system was designed to function inside the ancient Weltanschauung. The relationships referred to
by the "words" in our divinatory "language" apply to spiritual matters, as we have defined them. And because we want
to use this language to communicate with the "Spirits" (more precisely, with our "Spirit Guide"), we wanted
our vocabulary to be rich in the foundational notions that address matters of spirit--with the post-modern 
understanding that we are looking at self-regulating systems, and modelling the way in which this aspect of 
reality works. This is the reality we're interested in.

So, we must introduce the characters who shall enter into relationships and enact our dramas, which are allegories 
of both structure and process. Are these characters ruled by Fate or do they have Free Will? Both! As Heraclitus 
said "ΗΘΟΣ ΑΝΘΡΩΠΟΣ ΔΑΙΜΟΝ" (character is destiny). He was right.

## [How to Use \`ΡΥΘΜΟΙ : The Oracle of the Hyperboreans](#table-of-contents)

If you're new to Divination, we recognize the difficult nature of our language, and recommend you start with a
simpler system. You could choose a system like the Runes, or the 22 Major Arcana of the Tarot. If you intend to
keep going and learn to use our more complex system, you could start by learning the meanings we have associated 
with the Runes or the Tarot Major Arcana. 

There are many ways of performing divination, but the easiest ones for us have been:

* the "coin toss" method commonly used today for the I Ching
* picking up Runes from a "cast" of inscribed tiles or stones
* selecting Tarot cards from a spread out pile
* rolling dice, especially two, and then later, three six-sided dice 

We roll the 2 or 3 dice all at once, but you may opt to roll them one at a time.


#### [How to find the ὄνομα (name) using 3x6-sided dice](#table-of-contents)

Use the chart at [ΡΥΘΜΟΙ](#ρυθμοι). Read the dice right to left. Die number:

1. Determines which side (half) of the blocks of six ὀνόματα to take (when you divide the whole table along 
   the vertical axis at ΟΥΡΑΝΟΣ and ΓΑΙΑ). This die will also determine the nuance (if you decide to use 
   it) to be added to your answer.

   ```
   first half   second half
   * *   * *    * *   * *
   * *   * *    * *   * *
   * *   * *    * *   * *

   * *   * *    * *   * *
   * *   * *    * *   * *
   * *   * *    * *   * *

   * *   * *    * *   * *
   * *   * *    * *   * *
   * *   * *    * *   * *
   ```

2. Determines which block of six ὀνόματα in this half contains the answer. Count the blocks starting at 
   the left/top of the chosen half; count down the first column, then down the second.

   ```
      ? half 
      * *    * * 
   1  * *    * *  4
      * *    * * 

      * *    * * 
   2  * *    * *  5
      * *    * * 

      * *    * * 
   3  * *    * *  6
      * *    * * 
   ```

3. Determines the position of the ὄνομα in this block of six. Count the ὀνόματα starting at the left/top 
   and going down the first column, then down the second.

    ```
    1  * *  4
    2  * *  5
    3  * *  6
    ```

For the nuance, if the first die was:
   1-2 = beginning; overview; pattern; ΑΥΡΑ and ΛΙΜΝΗ
   3-4 = being; conflict; challenge; ΑΣΤΡΑΠΗ and `ΥΕΤΟΣ
   5-6 = becoming; action; decision; ΒΡΟΝΤΗ and ΟΡΟΣ

For example, I rolled my 3 six-sided dice and obtained the sequence "1 6 5", so reading these right to left I got...

+ 5
  I took the first half of the table, the side with columns headed by ΛΙΜΝΗ through ΟΥΡΑΝΟΣ.

+ 6
  I took the block of six ὀνόματα in the bottom right corner of that side.

+ 1
  I took the first ὄνομα in this block, which is ΓΡΥΨ. This was my answer. The answer was influenced by 
  the initial die's value of 5--in this case, the added nuance I used involved "becoming" and "action". 
  I understood this in the sense that this latest round of revisions of these instructions was improving, 
  was becoming better. If it is still unclear, you should see what I wrote before.


#### [How to find the ὄνομα (name) using two 12-sided dice](#table-of-contents)

Use the chart at [ΡΥΘΜΟΙ](#ρυθμοι). Read the dice right to left. Die number...

1. Determines which block of six contains the answer. Count the blocks starting at the left/top, then
   going down each block and continuing from the top again.

   ```
      * *      * *      * *       * *
   1  * *   4  * *   7  * *   10  * *
      * *      * *      * *       * *

      * *      * *      * *       * *
   2  * *   5  * *   8  * *   11  * *
      * *      * *      * *       * *

      * *      * *      * *       * *
   3  * *   6  * *   9  * *   12  * *
      * *      * *      * *       * *
   ```

2. Determines the position of the ὄνομα in the block. Count the ὀνόματα starting at the left/top and going 
   down the first column, then down the second. Okay, that covers 1 through 6; for 7 through 12,
   count down a second time.

    ```
    1/7  * *  4/10
    2/8  * *  5/11
    3/9  * *  6/12
    ```
   This die will also determine the nuance (if you decide to use it) to be added to your answer. For the
   nuance you can use:

   1-6  = meaning reversed; yin; what if things go wrong
   7-12 = meaning upright; yang; what if things go right

Of course, I had to do a cast with my two 12-sided dice to demonstrate. I got "6 11", so reading these
right to left...

+ 11
  I took the second to last block of six ὀνόματα, that is, the middle group of the rightmost groups
  in the table.

+ 6
  I took the last ὄνομα in this block--the one at the bottom right corner of this block, which is ΠΤΕΡΥΞ. 
  So, hopefully this way of determining the answer you may find useful. I hesitatingly thought of the 
  nuance that might be implied. Is there something not quite right about my explanation here? 
  
  I did another cast for clarification. You can do this, but do it sparingly and only after you've spent 
  at least a little time contemplating your original answer. In the I Ching discussion of Hexagram 
  4 which corresponds to ΠΤΕΡΥΞ, it warns against doing an additional inquiry and calls this an importunity.
  Of course! The clarification I got was ΧΑΡΥΒΔΙΣ... so yeah, this explanation is good enough for the moment.
  Fox loves to keep me on my toes.

If you're new to divination, or feel you need to cultivate a smaller set of ὀνόματα in your divinatory 
"language" (at least for now), here's a sub-set of ὀνόματα based on the Runes (in the way we've related 
them to the broader system). We call them ΑΙΝΙΓΜΑΤΑ (Enigmas) after a possible root meaning of "rune" 
as a "secret". In the entry for each ὄνομα, you'll find the original (reconstructed) Proto-Germanic 
appellation, as well as our Modern English one, plus our Modern English Rune poem stanza to use as a 
mnemonic.

#### [How to find the enigma using 2x6-sided dice](#table-of-contents)

Use the chart at the beginning of this section ([ΑΙΝΙΓΜΑΤΑ](#αινιγματα)). Read the dice right to left. Die number:

1. Determines which block of six ὀνόματα and ὄνομα pairs to take (see the numbering in the chart).
2. Determines the position of the ὄνομα or ὄνομα pair in the block of six that contains the answer. Count 
   the ὀνόματα (and pairs) starting at the left/top and going down the first column, then down the second.

    ```
    1  * *  4
    2  * *  5
    3  * *  6
    ```

For example, I rolled my 2 six-sided dice and obtained the sequence "6 5", so reading these right to 
left I got:

+ 5 => I took the block of six ὀνόματα and ὄνομα pairs in the top right corner of the chart.
+ 6 => I took the final ὄνομα pair in this block, which is [ΓΡΥΨ/Cauldron](#γρυψ) + [ΖΩΠΥΡΟΝ/Road](#ζωπυρον).

This was my answer. I understood this in the sense that Fox was telling me (Bärchen), that she answers in 
this way, and she has been doing so for a very long time. In other words, "you got it, Little Bear".

You may also, if your Spirit Guide approves, use this smaller system to check "omens". This is a very
advanced technique, and we must first give a stern warning that your Spirit Guide must agree to do this, 
and you must have a fair amount of divination expertise with this system (or a comparable one that you both 
design together) before you start this practice. It works like this: as you do free associative thinking 
(listening to the inner dialog, much as you would do when "contemplating" the possible meaning of a divinatory 
cast), if the feeling arises that you want to confirm the thought, or refine it, or possibly go in a different 
direction, then check the current time. Yes, we mean the time on your watch or clock or cell phone, 
specifically the minutes indicated. 

For example, I just checked the time a moment ago and it was 5:40pm, so I got 4-0. Now, just to confuse things, 
we take the first digit as indicator of the block of six ὀνόματα or pairs, and the second (least significant) 
digit as the ὄνομα or pair within that block which is your "omen". (We won't call it an "answer" because, as you 
might guess, this is nowhere near as accurate as doing an actual cast.) But wait! A roll of the dice would give
us two numbers between 1 and 6. Here we have a 4 and a 0, and recall that minutes can range from 00 to 59, so 
we suggest you use this scheme:

1st (most significant) digit:
+ 1-5 treat as you normally would
+ 0 convert that to a 6

2nd (least significant) digit:
+ 1-6 treat as you normally would
+ 7-9 start the count over, that is, convert to 1-3
+ 0 continue in that vein, that is, convert it to 4

So, the answer I got (40) gives me the 4th block of ὀνόματα and pairs, the 4th ὄνομα in that block which is 
[ΛΑΒΥΡΙΝΘΟΣ/Hail](#λαβυρινθος). Through much practice, I've learned that Fox is basically saying "The old 
fox knows the right place to cross", though sometimes she means "Restate the question and ask again". So I 
did (ask again, that is). It is now 6:08pm... Taking the sixth block of ὀνόματα and pairs, the second 
ὄνομα is [ΑΝΑΓΚΗ/Thorn](#αναγκη). The meaning for us is, admittedly, somewhat of a private interpretation 
drawn from long experience in this technique, but perhaps I can summarize it as "yes, you've got it, since 
you now understand the speech of birds (an omen), having tasted the Dragon's Heart". Did we mention that 
this is an advanced technique?! Use at your own risk and only if you both agree.

### [Astrological Correspondences and Symbolism](#table-of-contents)

#### The Zodiac

The Phases:
+ Cardinal = Becoming (Generating)
+ Fixed    = Being (Functioning)
+ Mutable  = Transforming (De/Re-generating)

The Processes:
+ Fire = initiate
  + sense internal state and external conditions and determine the best response or new state
  + Mountain and Lake (Wands)
+ Earth = establish
  + assign and execute the details of the response, as engaged by stimulus and inhibition, thus embodying the state
  + Heaven and Earth (Pentacles)
+ Air = communicate
  + encode, transmit, and receive data required for establishing and monitoring the state
  + Water and Fire (Swords)
+ Water = engage
  + initiate action based on the patterns of stimulus and inhibition which constitute the (new) state
  + Thunder and Wind (Cups)

The Phases and Processes give rise to the Zodiac.

| Planet  | Trigram  | additional correspondences                                                  |
| ------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Moon    | Earth    | Waxing = Venus/Wind; Full = Zodiac/Fire; Waning = Saturn/Lake               |
| Mercury | Water    |                                                                             |
| Venus   | Wind     |                                                                             |

| Jupiter | Mountain |                                                                             |
| Saturn  | Lake     |                                                                             |
| Zodiac  | Fire     |                                                                             |

When going from a cast (die roll) to Astrological symbolism, we must decide what Aspect the planets are 
in. The scale and table here can be used to calculate this.

**Scale for use with Planetary Aspects:**
+ higher --> lower
	+	Saturn --> Jupiter --> Mars --> Sun --> Venus --> Mercury --> Moon
	
| order of Trigrams  | 1st Die | Aspect      |
| ------------------ | ------- | ----------- |
| higher::lower      | 1-2     | Square      |
| higher::lower      | 3-4     | Trine       |
| higher::lower      | 5-6     | Conjunction |
| lower::higher      | 1-2     | Square      |
| lower::higher      | 3-4     | Sextile     |
| lower::higher      | 5-6     | Opposition  |

When the Zodiac (Fire) is one of the Trigrams (when calculating from a die roll), use one 12-sided dice to 
determine the sign. For Hexagrams in which Fire is the upper Trigram, consider the Planet to be retrograde 
in the sign, except for the Sun and Moon, which, conveniently matching the symbolism in our divinatory system, 
do not go retrograde.

This system of correspondences leaves out the doubled Trigrams (e.g. Mountain::Mountain/Eight of Wands/52 Stillness/ΠΥΛΑΙ).
In these cases, to continue your considerations in Astrological mode, consider the nature of the Planet (or 
of the Zodiac) itself, in its various relationships. In case it wasn't obvious, the symbolism of the doubled 
trigrams tends to focus on the most characteristic feature of this Trigram, whereas the symbolism we've attached 
to the Trigrams themselves in our system, remain broad. You can take these differences into consideration in 
Astrological mode, of course; no one is stopping you.


The possibility of creating this set of correspondences eluded us for a very long time, in no small part because 
the Zodiac is an alternative 12-step process to the classic 12 Steps of the AA; it is capable of broader associations 
because it more broadly associates the idea of Regeneration with mundane processes as well as Spiritual or Psychic 
Attainment.

Also, to state the obvious, all of the four processes (Fire::initiate, Earth::establish, Air::communicate, Water::engage) 
are taking place simultaneously throughout each phase of the process we wish to describe using this scheme. In this case, 
these processes are laid out sequentially for divinatory purposes. Horary Astrology, which is a form of divination that 
requires much training, of course, uses what we call the "Omen" method. We don't want to get into how this works in too 
much detail, lest we cause offense to the un-initiated, but the moment at which the question is asked determines the 
answer given. It works with clock time as well, but we have to confess we don't know how to do it with bird flight, 
entrails, or rustling leaves. For those, we imagine that there's a bit of pattern-matching going on along the lines 
of finding images in clouds. That, especially, we love to do, and yes, you can regain that skill as an adult. We 
haven't used it for divination. We just mention it as something to look forward to as you get to know your own 
Holy Guardian Angel better.

What about Natal Astrology? Again, we can't speak from direct experience, but we think the degree to which it "works" 
depends on how much it is seen as a declaration of the person's inevitable destiny. We hold, rather, that "character 
is destiny" and, since one can change one's character, one can change one's destiny. So, at best, it may be the set 
of challenges that Fate assigned you to contemplate, even though all challenges are worth contemplating if you intend 
to acquire Mastery of any sort.

Let's suppose for a moment that the original practice of Astrology, what it looked like at its beginning, was Horary.
More precisely, it was ascertaining the "tides" of the world. Then it was up to the practitioner to know whether the 
undertaking you were proposing might meet with success or failure, given those tides. The Stars did not determine 
fate, but like a clock, indicated where things stood in the cycles of the World, and what was happening in 
relationships with other people. (Do you still cling to the notion that Mankind has far too much Free Will, and
exercises it with such gusto, for the relationships among people to follow patterns in keeping with the natural 
world?)

It might have gone to shits in Babylon. Even as they did so much to advance observation, they couldn't help but
make Astrology more Civilized, by which we mean the Patriarchal and Hierarchical Warrior Cultures that introduced
the notion of Gods who determine the working of the World, because they are in authority over, and therefore 
cannot be part of, the Mundane World, just like their descendants who now rule on earth and must be obeyed.

Then it got mixed up with that truly horrible Four Elements system that everyone seems to adore. That was another
major source of confusion for us. Why is it horrible, you ask? What was the original symbolic referents of the 
Elements was apparently lost early on, and with the reification of the original symbol comes all sorts of 
illogical associations and illogical thinking. Especially when some or all of the Referents are now a property
of objects, not even an object or class of objects. (That ol' timey wet/dry, cold/hot fiasco.) Of course it 
would be turned into what we now consider Proto-Science; that had already been done through the reification.

So, if it's not clear, we cannot pretend to be restoring the original system--whatever it was is buried under
too much of what we consider detritus. Please consider this a rather free re-creation that might be useful for
some.

#### ΠΡΟΣΩΠΑ : The Characters in our Drama

+ **ΛΙΜΝΗ** = a pool of standing water left by the sea or a river, hence, marshy lake, mere, also an artificial 
pool or basin, in Homer and other Poets- the sea. [ΣΤΥΞ](#στυξ) 

+ **ΒΡΟΝΤΗ** = thunder, the state of one struck with thunder, astonishment. [\`ΥΔΡΑ](#υδρα)

+ **ΑΣΤΡΑΠΗ** = a flash of lightning, lightning, the light of a lamp, metaphorically of the flashing of the eyes. [ΧΑΛΚΟΣ](#χαλκος)

+ **ΟΥΡΑΝΟΣ** =  heaven, the vault or firmament of heaven, sky, heaven as the seat of the gods, outside or above 
this skyey vault, the portion of Zeus. As a proper noun: Uranos, son of Erebos and Gaia, but husband of 
Gaia, parent of Cronos and the Titans. [ΨΥΧΗ](#ψυχη)

+ **ΓΑΙΑ** = land, country, earth, earth as an element, the earth. As a proper noun: Earth. [ΩΟΝ](#ωον)

+ **\`ΥΕΤΟΣ** = rain, especially a heavy shower. [ΤΕΥΧΟΣ](#τευχος)

+ **ΑΥΡΑ** = a breeze, especially a cool breeze from water, or the fresh air of morning, αὔρῃ φιλοτησίῃ of the 
attractive influence of the female, metaphorically of the changeful course of events, or of a bodily thrill. [ΦΑΡΜΑΚΟΝ](#φαρμακον)

+ **ΟΡΟΣ** = mountain, hill. [\`ΡΑΨΩΙΔΟΣ](#ραψωιδος)


**Using the ΠΡΟΣΩΠΑ for a systems-theoretical view**

You can use this oracle within the context of a [systems-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory) 
view of a situation. The ΠΡΟΣΩΠΑ (our equivalent of the eight Trigrams of the I Ching) can be viewed as aspects 
of a simplified model of a system. We can apply the simplified model to assess the current state of affairs, see 
possible issues and patterns of dysfunction, and brainstorm possible approaches to a solution. Of course, the 
response we receive will be in the form of a metaphor, just as our simplified model is a metaphor for the actual, 
physical system. Nonetheless, I encourage the skeptical, not to forego their skepticism, but to participate in 
some good, old-fashioned, self-experimentation with this.

When you can't seem to find the correlation between your query and the answer you receive, or when the context of 
the query calls for it in the first place, look at the answer/ὄνομα (word) as suggesting that the current state 
of affairs may be due to the influence, for good or ill, that the functioning of the second aspect has (or has 
had) on the first. In I Ching terminology, this is the influence of the bottom Trigram on the top Trigram. For 
example, ΛΙΝΟΝ (▲ΑΣΤΡΑΠΗ :: ΟΡΟΣ▼, or I Ching Hexagram 56 The Wanderer which is Fire above Mountain) can encourage 
you to contemplate how your choices, and the "story" of your life, has altered or influenced your perception of 
the world at a very fundamental level. Note that such influence need not have a direct mechanism in a given system 
but, nonetheless, every part of a system, by performing its functions well or poorly, ultimately affects the whole 
and every other part.

You'll find the systems-theory view of the ΠΡΟΣΩΠΑ (Eight Trigrams) in the words devoted to them. See the links
above.

[!IMPORTANT]
Some of the meanings and associations attached to the ὀνόματα (words) of our divinatory system are completely arbitrary
(for example, the colors) or personal (inside jokes, if you will). Keep them or jettison them as you will. Eventually,
you'll want to refine the meanings and associations we give, make up your own, and possibly, when the time is ripe for
you, create your own system entirely.

  + comment: Well, we've landed. But there is that one last thing your boy Odysseus needs to do. And 
    before that, it would be good to get him well and truly settled in all aspects. You didn't imagine 
    you could just board up the doors and windows of the Palace and try to make it look like nothing had 
    happened, did you? How does his reclaimed identity inform his role and status in his family and 
    society? Don't go too far, and don't let him go too far, in eliminating his ties with the world.

  + The Magic Girdle of Aphrodite is φιλότητα καί ἵμερον = affection and desire
  + Sir Gawain and the Green Knight
  + passion(n.) https://www.etymonline.com/word/passion c. 1200, "the sufferings of Christ on the Cross; 
    the death of Christ," from Old French passion "Christ's passion, physical suffering" (10c.), from Late 
    Latin passionem (nominative passio) "suffering, enduring," from past-participle stem of Latin pati "to 
    endure, undergo, experience," a word of uncertain origin. The notion is "that which must be endured." 
    The sense was extended to the sufferings of martyrs, and suffering and pain generally, by early 13c. It 
    replaced Old English þolung (used in glosses to render Latin passio), literally "suffering," from þolian (v.) 
    "to endure." In Middle English also sometimes "the state of being affected or acted upon by something external" 
    (late 14c., compare passive). In Middle English also "an ailment, disease, affliction;" also "an emotion, 
    desire, inclination, feeling; desire to sin considered as an affliction" (mid-13c.). The specific meaning 
    "intense or vehement emotion or desire" is attested from late 14c., from Late Latin use of passio to 
    render Greek pathos "suffering," also "feeling, emotion." The specific sense of "sexual love" is attested 
    by 1580s, but the word has been used of any lasting, controlling emotion (zeal; grief, sorrow; rage, 
    anger; hope, joy). The meaning "strong liking, enthusiasm, predilection" is from 1630s; that of "object 
    of great admiration or desire" is by 1732. 
    > As compared with affection, the distinctive mark of passion is that it masters the mind, so that the 
    > person becomes seemingly its subject or its passive instrument, while an affection, though moving, 
    > affecting, or influencing one, still leaves him his self-control. The secondary meanings of the two 
    > words keep this difference. [Century Dictionary]

  + challenges: Can Odysseus escape fate and get to his true homecoming without losing his entire crew? 
    Apparently not!
  + result: The storm that detained them lifts and they begin, but immediately a fatal one (to the sailors) 
    descends. Shipwreck. Odysseus remains hidden for seven years on Calypso's island; not a bad place or 
    bad company, but still, there's no place like home and he's not there yet.
  + comment: Did you think your boy Odysseus would be the one to make it through in one go and not be 
    sabotaged by "business as usual"? Let's see if he can hold out for the long haul and the final attempt, 
    the one where all his tricks are played out and he has to rely on grace and no small bit of dumb luck.

  + In Norse mythology, the Norns are a trio of female beings who rule the destiny of gods and men, twining 
    the thread of life. They set up the laws and decided on the lives of the children of men. Their names were 
    Urðr, related with Old English wyrd, modern weird ("fate, destiny, luck"), Verðandi, and Skuld, and it has 
    often been concluded that they ruled over the past, present and future respectively, based on the sequence 
    and partly the etymology of the names, of which the first two (literally 'Fate' and 'Becoming') are derived 
    from the past and present stems of the verb verða, "to be", respectively, and the name of the third one 
    means "debt" or "guilt", originally "that which must happen". In younger legendary sagas, the Norns appear 
    to have been synonymous with witches (völvas), and they arrive at the birth of the hero to shape his destiny.

  preferred taste of a specific location's audience. However, the outer framework of the epic would remain 
  virtually the same in every "singing", thus securing the projection of underlying themes such as of morality

## [Shift happens! (Change is Inevitable)](#table-of-contents)

We sometimes use the Greek words for water (ὕδωρ) and fire (πῦρ) to represent the complementary processes 
that are involved in all change. As in the I Ching there are the complementary yin and yang, we use:

▼ὕδωρ / ▲πῦρ  = yin / yang  

▼ὕδωρ is related conceptually to κάλυψις ("covering, concealing"), and ▲πῦρ is related conceptually to 
ἀπο-κάλυψις ("uncovering, revealing"), which are (perhaps) closer to the original meanings of yin and yang, 
which have some connection to the shaded and sunny aspects of a hill.

In this cosmology, there is a connection between ▼κάλυψις (see [ΛΙΜΝΗ](#στυξ)) and ▲ἀπο-κάλυψις (see 
[ΟΡΟΣ](#ραψωιδος)), where κάλυψις makes suggestions and ἀπο-κάλυψις chooses among them. These work best 
together when they recognize, and act according to, a harmonious partnership, of course.

▼ὕδωρ is limiting; ▲πῦρ is expansive

▼ὕδωρ seeks differentiation and multiplicity; ▲πῦρ seeks reproducibility and order/structure

▼ὕδωρ is returning ; ▲πῦρ is going forth

▼ὕδωρ is attracting; ▲πῦρ is pursuing

▼ὕδωρ is diverging; ▲πῦρ is converging

▼ὕδωρ is being; ▲πῦρ is identity

Because of change, being must become birthing.
Because of change, identity must become becoming.

These aspects are not opposites but complements.

Do not bother asking yes/no questions, because this is a waste of time. 

If you know the answer, do not seek further confirmation or hope to find justification for doing what 
should not be done. Rather, ask for a fresh perspective or for an aspect you might not have considered.

If you do *not* know the answer, do not ask for the "last word" to be given to you, as if you might be
able to receive it directly. Rather, ask for an insight or inspiration that will lead to the answer as
part of your contemplation of it.

A higher level of competence in Divination comes in the ability to dialogue--a conversation in which you 
receive, and offer, insight, until a comfortable level of certainty is attained.

Sometimes, the answer comes in a way that can be taken as a direct confirmation, or rejection, of your 
understanding of a situation. But you must let this happen naturally, and it will be obvious in the 
circumstances. For example, when I had written the above paragraphs, I asked for a new take on it, leaving 
space, as it were, for a new perspective or a challenge to my current understanding. The answer I received 
was [ΗΛΕΚΤΡΟΝ](#ηλεκτρον), and I checked the interpretation of the reversed Ace of Cups on the Biddy Tarot 
website, I came across this:

"The reversed Ace of Cups is a sign that you are in connection with your subconscious mind and attuned 
to your intuition. You are exploring this part of yourself privately right now, and discovering how you 
can bring more intuition and flow into your life." 
(https://www.biddytarot.com/tarot-card-meanings/minor-arcana/suit-of-cups/ace-of-cups/)

So, alright then, I knew I was on the right track and my understanding would continue to deepen as I pursued
this line of thought.

## [Ritual](#table-of-contents)

Ritual is, fundamentally, a formalized meeting between a supplicant and a spiritual force, from which
the supplicant seeks a blessing or reward in exchange for a sacrifice (payment), which payment is usually 
offered in the course of the ritual, or by means of the ritual itself. This was, and still is, universally 
the function and meaning of ritual in pre-modern religions.

The Christian Mass is one example of the evolution of the ritual of sacrifice. Christianity limited its 
main ritual to a "giving thanks" (eucharist) for a past sacrifice (i.e. one not offered by the supplicant, 
which thereby denied any elevation of status to said supplicant). Its promised reward lies always in the 
future, but for the mystic the blessedness of union with the Divine is obtainable in the present.

For the postmodern mystic or shaman, spiritual forces, gods, or God in particular, do not exist in
their earlier, more naive, conception. And even though they do "exist" in the sense of being useful
metaphors for reasoning about the world, they are not addressable as if they had human personalities.
(Note that such "human" personalities were attributed to even the most theriomorphic gods or spirits in
pre-modern religions.) Nonetheless, for us, ritual still has value in dealing with "reality", just 
as the metaphors upon which earlier rituals were based have value, so far as they go.

The question for us is who is to be addressed...

The power of ritual is in "the way you act"--but in a broad sense which encompasses your motivation,
purpose, and emotional state. A ritual that evokes emotion, then binds this emotion to the "meaning"
of the ritual, has succeeded in its purpose. Another way of saying this is that ritual is a choreography
of remembrance. The degree to which we remember that to which the ritual points, and attach emotional 
power and significance to this, determines its efficacy. Hence, the actions and words of the ritual 
should free the mind to contemplate that to which they point, while the accoutrements of ritual should 
enhance the intended emotion, lending power to the whole.

For us, ritual may also be undertaken to bring about a desired outcome in the Universe. But we believe
this only has efficacy so far as it prepares us to react and respond to favorable conditions by which 
the desired outcome may be manifested. Also, ritual is useful for the "placebo effect"-- reducing anxiety 
to allow a clear path to healing. Once we have convinced ourselves that we have taken all steps necessary,
and all the possible eventual outcomes are accepted and harmonized in our emotional state, we give 
ourselves room to heal. The smoke alarm which goes off when there is a fire is only useful so far as it
gets us to move away from danger and request help. After that, it may interfere with our ability to hear
the instructions of our rescuers.


## [The Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel](#table-of-contents)

For our more mystical sisters and brethren, we offer this additional, first-hand account. But it comes with the
warning that the true knowledge is not a matter of power, but it is "Joy unspeakable and full of Glory. 
Oh the half has never yet been told!" 

> Wisdom has built her house,
> she has set up her seven pillars.
> She has slaughtered her beasts, she has mixed her wine,
>     she has also set her table.
> She has sent out her maids to call
>     from the highest places in the town,
> “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!”
>     To him who is without sense she says,
> “Come, eat of my bread
>     and drink of the wine I have mixed.
> Leave simpleness, and live,
>     and walk in the way of insight.”
> He who corrects a scoffer gets himself abuse,
>     and he who reproves a wicked man incurs injury.
> Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you;
>     reprove a wise man, and he will love you.
> Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser;
>     teach a righteous man and he will increase in learning.
> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,
>     and the knowledge of the Holy One[1] is insight.

[1]: An epithet of the Asherah, Yahweh's Consort.

To achieve the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, you yourself must begin the investigation,
and initiate the conversation. But how? How, if you haven't got the Knowledge and the Conversation already, are 
you to do this? 

First and foremost, the Call is in the Desire. And to that Desire the Will must consent. So choose to study yourself.
Who is the person who wishes to receive the Call? Study divination, for the Angel may wish to use it to communicate 
with you, as is their prerogative. So ask. If it is, and once you achieve some skill in it, ask your Holy Guardian 
to speak to you through it. Since a divinatory system is (or should be) a type of language, you should gain fluency in it.
Analyze and memorize the symbols and how they relate and interact, and how they can be formed into sentences. Learn
by conversing. Continue to probe the nuances and possibilities of your language. Then use it to ask your Holy Guardian 
what they envision for you, and what steps you next should take.

Eventually, you'll be ready to construct the Philosopher's Stone...

### [The Twelve Steps](#table-of-contents)

The "Twelve Steps" are a path by which one's Persona may be altered. This applies as much to the Adept as it does to the Addict.
For both, all the steps are best re-taken at periodic intervals. For those on the Path of Enlightenment, there is indeed a "once and done"
level, but the higher levels involve, indeed require, a constant state of development (or perhaps it is better to say, of reconstruction).

The reason for identifying and delineating these 12 steps or stages is to assist in establishing conditions in which they might proceed 
uninterrupted toward success, or so that points of failure might be identified when results are not as expected or hoped for. Here 
we take a look at the Twelve Steps from the viewpoint of [Systems Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory). The viewpoint
of Myth is covered in the main text of the \`ΡΥΘΜΟΙ. 

1. Calcination / Admit Failure 

   * *Sense/detect* a challenge in the inner or outer environment that requires a modification to the status quo, that presents a problem to 
     be solved. Something is out of balance/harmony. More technically, a signal is received which denotes that something doesn't match the 
     system's self-identity, or has strayed beyond the system's operating parameters. (Seven: A)

2. Solution / Believe in Restoration 

   * *Identify* the nature of the challenge or change, and (in more complex systems) the general outline of the new point of equilibrium to be achieved
     to match it. The system may correlate several signals to more precisely identify the situation. As later steps unfold, it will evaluate what parts 
     of its self-identity it will need to change to adapt and thereby maintain its continued existence, or what counter-measures might be available to it 
     to use in response to a threat. At this point the system must now assemble a situation, or choose between alternatives, in order to be able to then 
     plan and execute a series of steps. 

3. Separation / Submit the Will 

   * *Signal/command* (i.e. transmit) the signal or signals (information) required to initiate the needed changes. Internal signals are generated based 
     on the pattern identified by the system's sensorium in the previous step. In animals, these can lead to "instinctual" or "social" responses as well. 
     (Seven: B)

4. Conjunction / Take Inventory 

   * *Audit/ACK* (i.e. identify) the new "set point". As a first step in creating or identifying its response, the system must match up current conditions 
     with its store of general patterns. Also, at this point it may consult its sub-systems which hold a generalized image of the system's self-identity 
     and which ultimately express themselves as a set of attractions and repulsions, anticipated pleasures and pains or, more fundamentally, positive and 
     negative feedback loops. (Seven: C)

5. Putrefaction / Clarification 

   * *Inter-communication* between sub-systems, evaluation of feasibility, resources and needs. The pattern most closely resembling the new desired 
     condition is worked out; the main outlines of the plan (if any), and the overall desired end state of the system are identified.

6. Congelation / Letting Go (Receptivity) 

    * *(Re)Arrange* - Refinement of the "whole picture" now is accomplished-- both of the new set-point and the set-points and steps required of each 
      sub-system. At this point, the original signal and any internal signals indicating the initial challenge may be shut off or damped down so as to 
      avoid overcompensation or overdrive of the system. The system then puts things in the new order. In software, this step applies the patch to an 
      image of the operating system in preparation for a re-boot. (Seven: D)

7. Cibation / Remove Shortcomings 

   * *(Re)Set* - The reset signal is given. In software, the system will now shut down in preparation to run the boot loader program.

8. Sublimation / Consider the Consequences  

   * *(Re)Start/Boot* - Transformation first phase-- the system restarts. In software, we run the boot loader. (Seven: E)

9. Fermentation / Make Amends (Do the Work) 

   * *Execute* - Transformation second phase-- a chaotic phase before the new order is achieved. The sub-systems may seem to be dis-coordinated 
     as they adapt to their newly assigned set point values, but soon the system as a whole will take on its new order. In software, the newly 
     modified operating system initializes. (Seven: F)

10. Exaltation / Practice Makes Perfect 

    * *Sense/Id/Transmit* - The tide has turned, the new order is established. The new processes of identification (detection), planning, communicating 
      and executing according to the new order and situation begin. In software, the new operating system is fully functional and begins running the 
      default applications and checking for inputs.

11. Multiplication / The Path of Prayer 

    * *Maintain/Improve* the new order and make its behaviors "learned" (instinctual), as well as improve on them (given time for reflection 
      and analysis). As far as possible, the system "learns" from the encounter, and may even be capable of evolving new patterns of responses 
      based on generalizations or implications inherent in its existing patterns and the relative success or failure of its plan or stability of
      the new equilibrium. (Seven: G)

12. Projection / Evangelization 

    * *Replicate/Teach* - the system gains the ability to communicate and teach the analyzed and perfected behavior to others. If the system 
      which is transformed is part of a larger system or community, it may be able to communicate its findings to that broader system, or to 
      others in its community, or both. This communication may itself be in the form of a signal which sets off a similar process in that entity. 
      This step also recognizes the impact which the change in the system has on its environment, potentially setting the stage for additional 
      adjustments or reactions which may be needed as a result.

### [The Seven](#table-of-contents)

The Seven are the 12 Steps or stages in which maintenance is key, as in many living systems, and in most 
systems most of the time. They take us through the stages of life from birth to reproduction. The Twelve 
adds those steps or stages in which memory, planning, and evaluating are used to self-correct the system. 
(Those are systems that can learn, in other words.)

In regard to Yao, note that (contrary to most historic I Ching accounts) we are inserting a yin or yang line in the middle to obtain the Trigrams: 

+ Old Yin (Black Tortoise) `0::0` gives rise to:
  - `0:0:0` Earth - ΓΑΙΑ
  - `0:1:0` Water - **`ΥΕΤΟΣ**
+ Young Yin (White Tiger) `1::0` gives rise to:
  - `1:0:0` Mountain - ΟΡΟΣ
  - `1:1:0` Wind - **ΑΥΡΑ**
+ Old Yang (Vermillion Bird) `1::1` gives rise to:
  - `1:0:1` Fire - **ΑΣΤΡΑΠΗ**
  - `1:1:1` Heaven - ΟΥΡΑΝΟΣ
+ Young Yang (Azure Dragon) `0::1` gives rise to:
  - `0:0:1` Thunder - **ΒΡΟΝΤΗ**

   c. John the Baptist declares for Jesus.
   d. The woman at the well and her fellow Samaritans believe.
   e. But the people at home are a tough audience, so, for now, he goes back to Cana.

2. The Official's Son -> no actions, no teachings

   In your work, you must acquiesce to the needs of others and be accepting of them, so they will support you.

3. The Pool of Bethesda -> Jesus' authority comes from his obedience to the true will of God

   Know the Rules and when to break them for the good of others.

   a. Jesus discourses on the nature and origin of his authority.

4. Five Loaves and Two Fish -> Jesus avoids being made a king, but no related teachings (yet)

   Ignore the cost, and the temptation to keep what you already have for just yourself, "and
   you give yourself away".

5. The Sea of Galilee -> Jesus catches up with the disciples with the Sea's cooperation

   Fully trust the process and you will be upheld by the depths.

   a. Reprise of Five Loaves and Two Fish - "*I am the Bread of Life*" (1) (I am Food).
   b. That's too hard for some disciples; not everyone can cross this bridge.
   c. Jesus' own brothers still don't believe, and now it is clear that the authorities
      have figured out he is a real threat and start looking for ways to kill him, so,
      initially, he hides out.
   d. Jesus appears in Jerusalem, and his preaching again divides the public--some seek 
      to kill him while others believe.
   d. "Rivers of Living Water" reprises the trust in, and validating work of, the depths.
   e. Decisions begin to take shape for those who believe and those who don't.
   f. The woman caught in adultery is not condemned.
   g. "*I am the Light of the World*" (2)
   h. "*Before Abraham was, I am*"

6. The Pool of Siloam

   Jesus could heal the Official's Son with a word and at a distance, but here he takes the trouble of
   making clay (thereby breaking the Sabbath Rule), and sending the man born blind to a pool to
   wash it off. Plus Jesus is not *restoring* sight, but giving it for the first time. The man
   describes it as an "anointing" with clay rather than with oil.

   Clarity of vision is needed now, more than ever, and "trust God, but row toward shore." Although, much
   of the teaching here is, unfortunately, "we could have agreement (concord) if only y'all listened to, 
   and accepted, God's authority".

   a. The Pharisees investigate, but they don't get the right answer. They're not willing to
      question what they think they know. "If you were blind, you would have no guilt; but 
      now that you say, ‘We see,' your guilt remains."
   b. "*I am the Door of the Sheep*" (3)
   c. "*I am the Good Shepherd*" (4)
   d. "*I and the Father are one*"

7. The Tomb at Bethany

   First, timing is everything. Jesus could have come sooner and just healed Lazarus, but instead...

   a. "*I am the Resurrection and the Life*" (5)
   b. "Unbind him and let him go"
   c. "*I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life*" (6)
   d. "*I am the Vine*" (7)
   e. Next, it's Jesus' turn...

## [The Three Principles and the Four Elements:](#table-of-contents)

These are the 3 principles (aspects of our thinking) that, together, enable us to constitute "things". These aspects join together
to give rise to a fourth aspect, and so become the 4 elements, that is, the "stuff" out of which all "things" are "made". This is
actually describing the operation of the mind in making sense of the "universe" (whatever that is), but here again, we incorrectly 
give these an existence outside our own mind, or outside any mind except that of God. In this way we mistake the use of the
metaphor for the recognition of a truth or fact. To put it another way, we substitute a cosmogony and cosmology, or worse yet, a
theology or theogony, for an epistemology. Or to put it a third way, we make unto ourselves a graven image then bow down to it and 
worship it.

Using the names of the classical elements, then, we have:

1. Water
   The principle of attraction and repulsion. In physics, we often call this "potential energy". In systems theory, this
   is positive and negative feedback.

2. Air
   The principle of communication and sensation. (This is the basis for the First Law of Thermodynamics--
   the "conservation" of energy means that there must be equality between the force that is communicated
   by a thing and that which is sensed by another thing.) Implied here is the principle of separation
   (ultimately, a lack of communication and sensation) along with the closing of that gap when communication
   does take place. But it also implies "classification"-- that is, sorting, the basis of classification
   implies both division and combination, along with limitation; see the next principle. 

3. Fire
   The principle of identity and change (hence "energy" or "power" which can only be detected
   and measured by reference to identity and change). Heraclitus calls Fire the first principle because
   he wishes to see through the lens of change. This principle can also be seen in terms of number
   which implies both infinity and limit-- possible values are unbounded, but once a number is determined,
   a measurement made, the "wave function collapses". Implied here also is the principle of "pattern", determined
   by the elucidation of the changes made by an "identity" in spatial, temporal, or some other quantifiable
   terms.

4. Earth
   The principle of "adaptation" and "homeostasis", which can be attributed to a system (or "whole") that arises in the 
   interworking of the other three. And yet, this is also used to denote the base elements that constitute the system,
   and will become the "basis" of the next system. Or, you can look the other way down the telescope and attempt to 
   describe or analyze a thing in terms of its constituent parts, apparently ad infinitum. Just don't forget to see the 
   forest (the system) for the trees (the parts). In other words, we must consciously, but not slavishly, construct our
   models and metaphors according to their predictive power.


Paracelsus had a different way of dividing the conceptual framework. He recognized:

1. Mercury
   The principle of "volatility", which is probably a combination of "repulsion" and "identity", along with that
   latter's sense of "separation"-- of self from other and of other from other. Note the parallelism with the common
   notion of "spirit" as something separate from "matter", yet which participates in it (somehow, which is never 
   explained) to give it its identity.

2. Sulphur
   The principle of "change", which brings with it the idea of (kinetic) "energy". This also contains the principles
   of "communication" and "sensation" which form the "bridge between mercury and salt". The idea here is that spirit
   communicates the information which gives the sensing and receptive matter its form or nature or whatever. (The terms
   here are many and varied, but all problematic, ultimately, because they make us think that there is something
   "out there" without recognizing that we make it all up (all our knowledge of the world) from what we are able to
   sense and the patterns into which we divide these sensations.

3. Salt
   The principle of, well, everything else. This is "matter" (or "Earth" in 4-part scheme discussed above), and it
   is actually a great big grab-bag of all the principles we have discussed, working themselves out so that a "thing"
   appears to us. (Again, to beat a dead horse, God only knows what's actually outside us, so we mistake our concept
   for "reality". We make this mistake twice over when we create second-tier notions, like "Beauty", or "Justice" or
   "God" ("the Good" for Platonists), ascribe to them an existence independent of our mind, then (hopefully) worry
   about the logical inconsistencies we ourselves have created.

   So we'd say "adaptation" and "homeostasis", but this is because we see every "thing" as "system" which seeks to
   maintain its continuance in the universe *as* a system. Well, at least anything "living", and probably, very 
   surprisingly, atoms, although everything in between should be carefully considered. Oh, and societies too.
   Other "things" appear to our minds as "things" for the (usually) very good reason that lumping them into their
   particular categories increases our predictive power, and hence our own survival as a system, and the survival
   of our offspring or society. At least, that's the standard by which they ought to be judged.

Other ideas attached themselves to these in Paracelsus' mind, mostly derived by association with the properties of 
the actual chemical substances he used as symbols. He probably performed this example of "analogical thinking" in 
keeping with the patterns of thought which were current in his society at the time-- the European Christian idea 
of the Great Chain of Being, with God the Royal Sovereign issuing His Commands, which all Created Things must obey, 
or not, to their Peril.

## [On the Daemon of Socrates](#table-of-contents)

> We found them engaged in a notable dispute, which Galaxidorus and Phidolaus had touched upon before; 
> the subject of the enquiry was this,—What kind of substance or power was the famed Daemon of Socrates? 
> Simmias's reply to Galaxidorus's discourse we did not hear; but he said that, having once asked Socrates 
> about it and received no answer, he never repeated the same question; but he had often heard him 
> declare those to be vain pretenders who said they had seen any divine apparition, while to those who 
> affirmed that they heard a voice he would gladly hearken, and would eagerly enquire into the particulars. 
> And this upon consideration gave us probable reasons to conjecture that this Daemon of Socrates was not an 
> apparition, but rather a sensible perception of a voice, or an apprehension of some words, which after an 
> unaccountable manner affected him; as in a dream there is no real voice, yet we have fancies and 
> apprehensions of words which make us imagine that we hear some speak. 

> This perception in dreams is usual, 
> because the body whilst we are asleep is quiet and undisturbed; but when we are awake, meaner thoughts 
> creep in, and we can hardly bring our souls to observe better advertisements. For being in a hurry of 
> tumultuous passions and distracting business, we cannot compose our mind or make it listen to the 
> discoveries. But Socrates's understanding being pure, free from passion, and mixing itself with the body no 
> more than necessity required, was easy to be moved and apt to take an impression from every thing that was 
> applied to it; now that which was applied was not a voice, but more probably a declaration of a Daemon, by 
> which the very thing that it would declare was immediately and without audible voice represented to his 
> mind. 

> Voice is like a stroke given to the soul, which receives speech forcibly entering at the ears whilst 
> we discourse; but the understanding of a more excellent nature affects a capable soul, by applying the very 
> thing to be understood to it, so that there is no need of another stroke. And the soul obeys, as it 
> stretches or slackens her affections, not forcibly, as if it wrought by contrary passions, but smoothly and 
> gently, as if it moved flexible and loose reins. And sure nobody can wonder at this, that hath observed 
> what great ships of burden are turned by a small helm, or seen a potter's wheel move round by the 
> gentle touch of one finger. These are lifeless things, it is true; but being of a frame fit for motion, by 
> reason of their smoothness, they yield to the least impulse. The soul of man, being stretched with a 
> thousand inclinations, as with cords, is the most tractable instrument that is, and if once rationally 
> excited, easy to be moved to the object that is to be conceived; for here the beginnings of the passions
>  and appetites spread to the understanding mind, and that being once agitated, they are drawn back again, 
> and so stretch and raise the whole man. Hence you may guess how great is the force of a conception when it 
> hath entered the mind; for the bones that are insensible, the nerves, the flesh that is full of humors, and 
> the heavy mass composed of all these, lying quiet and at rest, as soon as the soul gives the impulse and 
> raiseth an appetite to move towards any object, are all roused and invigorated, and every member seems a 
> wing to carry it forward to action. Nor is it impossible or even very difficult to conceive the manner of 
> this motion and stirring, by which the soul having conceived any thing draweth after her, by means of 
> appetites, the whole mass of the body. But inasmuch as language, apprehended without any sensible voice, 
> easily excites; so, in my opinion, the understanding of a superior nature and a more divine soul may excite 
> an inferior soul, touching it from without, like as one speech may touch and rouse another, and as light 
> causes its own reflection. 

> We, it is true, as it were groping in the dark, find out one another's 
> conceptions by the voice; but the conceptions of the Daemons carry a light with them, and shine to those 
> that are able to perceive them, so that there is no need of words such as men use as signs to one another, 
> seeing thereby only the images of the conceptions, and being unable to see the conceptions themselves 
> unless they enjoy a peculiar and (as I said before) a divine light. This may be illustrated from the nature 
> and effect of voice; for the air being formed into articulate sounds, and made all voice, 
> transmits the conception of the soul to the hearer; so that it is no wonder if the air, that is very apt to 
> take impressions, being fashioned according to the object conceived by a more excellent nature, signifies 
> that conception to some divine and extraordinary men. For as a stroke upon a brazen shield, when the noise 
> ariseth out of a hollow, is heard only by those who are in a convenient position, and is not perceived by 
> others; so the speeches of the Daemon, though indifferently applied to all, yet sound only to those who are 
> of a quiet temper and sedate mind, and such as we call holy and divine men. 

> Most believe that Daemons 
> communicate some illuminations to men asleep, but think it strange and incredible that they should 
> communicate the like to them whilst they are awake and have their senses and reason vigorous; as vise a 
> fancy as it is to imagine that a musician can use his harp when the strings are slack, but cannot play when 
> they are screwed up and in tune. For they do not consider that the effect is hindered by the unquietness 
> and incapacity of their own minds; from which inconveniences our friend Socrates was free, as the oracle 
> assured his father whilst he was a boy. For that commanded him to let young Socrates do what he would, not 
> to force or draw him from his inclinations, but let the boy's humor have its free course; to beg Jupiter's

Anyway, sorry to disappoint, but most modern advocates and practitioners of High Magic claim their real 
reason for pursuing its disciplines is the transformation of the Soul (by which they probably mean the 
personality). Yes, well, then they tease us by claiming that the ability to transform "things" is indicative 
of progress along these lines, even if it is a potential distraction from that truer end. Again, why not 
work within the normal order of things? Why spend 30 years learning how to bend a spoon with your mind 
alone, when you can accomplish the same thing with some tools you can buy at your local hardware store?
